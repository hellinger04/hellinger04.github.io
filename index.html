            <h2>Andrew Hellinger</h2>
            <h3>My mission is to build a body of evidence and momentum towards a transportation 
                system in the United States that is human-scaled, safe, equitable, and accessible to all.
                I recognize that many American communities are built on the scale of motor vehicles,
                requiring homes, businesses, and schools to be spaced so far apart that they are 
                inaccessible by foot. These communities often lack reliable transit, protected bike 
                lanes, and connected sidewalks, making driving essential. While residents in car-centric
                communities cannot reach essential resources without a car, driving comes with its own 
                health risks including increased risk of obesity, stress, and life-altering injury or 
                death from motor vehicle crashes.
                <br><br>
                Human-scaled design emphasizes walkability and the movement of people over cars 
                through mixed-use development, shorter blocks, accessible and wide sidewalks, 
                and reduced car traffic and speeds. Transportation systems that are built on a
                human-scale empower car-alternative and active transportation options that not 
                only improve mobility equity but also provide powerful health benefits. Research 
                on active transportation has shown that commuters who regularly choose to walk, 
                bike, or take transit to their destination experience better health than those 
                who drive, one reason why the CDC has identified transportation along with 
                neighborhood and built environment as key social determinants of health.
                <br><br>
                I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in May 2020 with a
                degree in public health and computer science. Over the past several years,
                I have been conducting innovative research on the health effects of both car 
                and car-alternative transportation options at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg 
                School of Public Health. I have a broad and varied skillset with strong 
                experience in design, software engineering, data analysis, and critical writing.
