    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"Baltimore’s public transportation infrastructure is failing Baltimoreans. It is failing low
            and mid-income Baltimoreans, who are disproportionately cut off from job opportunities and forced to endure
            extremely long commutes. It is failing Baltimore’s students who are cut off from employment and educational
            opportunities as they try to make their way out of poverty. It is failing the health of all Baltimoreans by
            preventing access to fresh food and healthcare and by discouraging walking and biking as part of commutes.
            If Baltimore invests in new public transportation systems that are safe, reachable, reliable, and rapid, our
            city can see improved health outcomes through greater transportation efficiency."

        <h1 class="black-text">02: Parent Misconceptions about Vehicle Safety Technologies</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info-writing-black">
        <h2 class="black-text">"Most teenagers drive older vehicles, which are known to have inferior safety features
            relative to newer vehicles. Parents typically provide the vehicle that their children will drive, but little
            is known about their decision making process and motivation. Addressing this underexplored area is the
            primary focus of this research. Parents were recruited from local Maryland driving schools to participate in
            focus groups. Semi-structured questions explored parental decision making and motivation for vehicle
            selection for their teenager.
            <br><br>
            Most parents downplayed the risk of injury in the event of a crash, dismissed vehicle safety technologies as
            ineffective, or felt that reliance on technology would impede the development of their teen’s driving
            skills. A minority expressed a positive view toward safety technology and consulted objective sources of
            information to guide their decision making when selecting the vehicle their teenager would drive. Parents
            appear to be engaging temporal discounting when selecting a vehicle for their teenagers, in which immediate
            costs are disproportionately weighed against the future injury risk. Misconceptions about vehicle age and
            crash-worthiness could be addressed in education campaigns."</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"On my daily walk to the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus, I must cross University Parkway. The
            location of my apartment building makes it easiest and quickest to cross University Parkway directly in
            front of the North Gate without using a crosswalk. According to Google Maps, the length of this path is
            approximately 285 feet. It would be much safer to walk to the nearest pedestrian crosswalk at Charles
            Street, but the length of this path is approximately 988 feet. This means that I would have to walk over 700
            additional feet to safely and lawfully cross University Parkway. For a college student, who may be running
            late to class and is generally short on time, it incredibly tempting to take a shortcut and cross University
            Parkway without using a marked crosswalk.
            <br><br>
            I am studying ways to prevent and control traffic injuries through public health interventions, and I have
            taken courses from leading injury prevention experts who have taught that it is essential to 'make the
            safest way the easiest way.' In the case of University Parkway, the safest way for many students is too
            difficult to reach, which is why I consistently observe students crossing this street in an unsafe way."

        <h1 class="black-text">04: The Role of Sympathy in Chicago Public Housing Reform</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info-writing-black">
        <h2 class="black-text">"Some might consider it sympathy when someone is 'imagining how he himself might feel were he
            to be placed in the exact same situation' as someone else. However, Fennell argues, since this person is
            only imagining this situation and is not in the situation, this would be more adequately described as
            empathy. Per Fennell, sympathy is beyond just feeling <strong>for</strong> someone; it is feeling
            <strong>with</strong> them. Sympathy means that you can reason with someone’s state, but you can also get
            down to the level of their state, drawing from a set of shared conditions and experiences. When experiencing
            sympathy, you and the other person are resonating on the same wavelength; you just get each other. The
            Chicago Housing Authority believed that, by forging sympathetic bonds between people, they could address and
            mitigate many of the problems that public housing residents faced."
