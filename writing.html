    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"Baltimore’s public transportation infrastructure is failing Baltimoreans. It is failing low
            and mid-income Baltimoreans, who are disproportionately cut off from job opportunities and forced to endure
            extremely long commutes. It is failing Baltimore’s students who are cut off from employment and educational
            opportunities as they try to make their way out of poverty. It is failing the health of all Baltimoreans by
            preventing access to fresh food and healthcare and by discouraging walking and biking as part of commutes.
            If Baltimore invests in new public transportation systems that are safe, reachable, reliable, and rapid, our
            city can see improved health outcomes through greater transportation efficiency."

    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"Most teenagers drive older vehicles, which are known to have inferior safety features
            relative to newer vehicles. Parents typically provide the vehicle that their children will drive, but little
            is known about their decision making process and motivation. Addressing this underexplored area is the
            primary focus of this research. Parents were recruited from local Maryland driving schools to participate in
            focus groups. Semi-structured questions explored parental decision making and motivation for vehicle
            selection for their teenager.
            <br><br>
            Most parents downplayed the risk of injury in the event of a crash, dismissed vehicle safety technologies as
            ineffective, or felt that reliance on technology would impede the development of their teen’s driving
            skills. A minority expressed a positive view toward safety technology and consulted objective sources of
            information to guide their decision making when selecting the vehicle their teenager would drive. Parents
            appear to be engaging temporal discounting when selecting a vehicle for their teenagers, in which immediate
            costs are disproportionately weighed against the future injury risk. Misconceptions about vehicle age and
            crash-worthiness could be addressed in education campaigns."</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"As I get settled in, I focus on the needle of the speedometer as it slowly creeps downward to
            0 mph, remaining there for hours as if it’s on an extended lunch break. We sit behind 10,000 other vehicles
            in line to merge onto I-85. My dad turns off the car, abruptly ending the flow of cool air and bringing my
            attention to the might of the full summer sun, now unobstructed by the moon. I abandon my seat belt and lay
            down across both rear seats, trying to mimic my soft bed at home. I dream of laying in that bed now; those
            two firm white pillows, the eggshell sheets, all covered with a plump grey comforter."</h2>
