        <h2 class="white">The learner stage of graduated driver licensing, when teenagers are supervised by an
          adult driver, represents an opportunity to develop skills that could confer a safety benefit during their
          years of independent driving. This paper describes the design of a teenage driving study which aims to
          evaluate the impact of a smartphone application, the ‘DrivingApp,’ to increase the quantity and improve the
          quality of supervised practice driving.

    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">This article reviews existing state laws related to autonomous vehicle safety, equity,

          are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these laws in order to guide further policy development.

        <h2 class="subheading">Published in Injury Prevention on March 16, 2022</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">The purpose of this article is to identify, describe, and critique state and local policies related to child passenger safety in for-hire motor
          vehicles including ridesharing and taxis. We used standard legal research methods to collect policies governing the use of child restraint systems (CRS) in
          rideshare and taxi vehicles for all 50 states and the 50 largest cities in the U.S. We abstracted the collected policies to determine whether the policy applies
          to specific vehicles, requires specific safety restraints in those vehicles, lists specific requirements for use of those safety restraints, seeks to enhance
          compliance, and punishes noncompliance.
          <br><br>
          All 50 states have policies that require the use of CRS for children under a certain age, weight, or height. Seven states exempt rideshare vehicles and 29 states
          exempt taxis from their CRS requirements. Twelve cities have relevant policies with eight requiring CRS in rideshare vehicles, but not taxis, and two cities requiring
          CRS use in both rideshare vehicles and taxis. Most states require CRS use in rideshare vehicles, but not as many require CRS use in taxis. Though states describe penalties
          for drivers who fail to comply with CRS requirements, these penalties do not actually facilitate the use of CRS in rideshare or taxis. Furthermore, there is ambiguity
          in the laws about who is responsible for the provision and installation of the restraints. To prevent serious or fatal injuries in children, policy makers should adopt
          policies that require, incentivize, and facilitate the use of CRS in rideshare vehicles and taxis.

    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"Baltimore’s public transportation infrastructure is failing Baltimoreans. It is failing low
            and mid-income Baltimoreans, who are disproportionately cut off from job opportunities and forced to endure
            extremely long commutes. It is failing Baltimore’s students who are cut off from employment and educational
            opportunities as they try to make their way out of poverty. It is failing the health of all Baltimoreans by
            preventing access to fresh food and healthcare and by discouraging walking and biking as part of commutes.
            If Baltimore invests in new public transportation systems that are safe, reachable, reliable, and rapid, our
            city can see improved health outcomes through greater transportation efficiency."

        <h1 class="black-text">05: Parent Misconceptions about Vehicle Safety Technologies</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info-writing-black">
        <h2 class="black-text">"Most teenagers drive older vehicles, which are known to have inferior safety features
            relative to newer vehicles. Parents typically provide the vehicle that their children will drive, but little
            is known about their decision making process and motivation. Addressing this underexplored area is the
            primary focus of this research. Parents were recruited from local Maryland driving schools to participate in
            focus groups. Semi-structured questions explored parental decision making and motivation for vehicle
            selection for their teenager.
            <br><br>
            Most parents downplayed the risk of injury in the event of a crash, dismissed vehicle safety technologies as
            ineffective, or felt that reliance on technology would impede the development of their teen’s driving
            skills. A minority expressed a positive view toward safety technology and consulted objective sources of
            information to guide their decision making when selecting the vehicle their teenager would drive. Parents
            appear to be engaging temporal discounting when selecting a vehicle for their teenagers, in which immediate
            costs are disproportionately weighed against the future injury risk. Misconceptions about vehicle age and
            crash-worthiness could be addressed in education campaigns."</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"Some might consider it sympathy when someone is 'imagining how he himself might feel were he
            to be placed in the exact same situation' as someone else. However, Fennell argues, since this person is
            only imagining this situation and is not in the situation, this would be more adequately described as
            empathy. Per Fennell, sympathy is beyond just feeling <strong>for</strong> someone; it is feeling
            <strong>with</strong> them. Sympathy means that you can reason with someone’s state, but you can also get
            down to the level of their state, drawing from a set of shared conditions and experiences. When experiencing
            sympathy, you and the other person are resonating on the same wavelength; you just get each other. The
            Chicago Housing Authority believed that, by forging sympathetic bonds between people, they could address and
            mitigate many of the problems that public housing residents faced."
