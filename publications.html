        <h2 class="white">The learner stage of graduated driver licensing, when teenagers are supervised by an
          adult driver, represents an opportunity to develop skills that could confer a safety benefit during their
          years of independent driving. This paper describes the design of a teenage driving study which aims to
          evaluate the impact of a smartphone application, the ‘DrivingApp,’ to increase the quantity and improve the
          quality of supervised practice driving.

        <h2 class="subheading">Published in Injury Prevention on March 16, 2022</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">The purpose of this article is to identify, describe, and critique state and local policies related to child passenger safety in for-hire motor
          vehicles including ridesharing and taxis. We used standard legal research methods to collect policies governing the use of child restraint systems (CRS) in
          rideshare and taxi vehicles for all 50 states and the 50 largest cities in the U.S. We abstracted the collected policies to determine whether the policy applies
          to specific vehicles, requires specific safety restraints in those vehicles, lists specific requirements for use of those safety restraints, seeks to enhance
          compliance, and punishes noncompliance.
          <br><br>
          All 50 states have policies that require the use of CRS for children under a certain age, weight, or height. Seven states exempt rideshare vehicles and 29 states
          exempt taxis from their CRS requirements. Twelve cities have relevant policies with eight requiring CRS in rideshare vehicles, but not taxis, and two cities requiring
          CRS use in both rideshare vehicles and taxis. Most states require CRS use in rideshare vehicles, but not as many require CRS use in taxis. Though states describe penalties
          for drivers who fail to comply with CRS requirements, these penalties do not actually facilitate the use of CRS in rideshare or taxis. Furthermore, there is ambiguity
          in the laws about who is responsible for the provision and installation of the restraints. To prevent serious or fatal injuries in children, policy makers should adopt
          policies that require, incentivize, and facilitate the use of CRS in rideshare vehicles and taxis.

        <h2 class="subheading">Published by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on October 13, 2022</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of
          the logbook format (i.e., paper vs. a smartphone application [app]) on
          self-reported learner driving behavior. For those who used the app
        (the electronic logbook), we compared the agreement between their
        survey-reported trips and the trips recorded by the app and asked about
        their perceptions of using an app to measure driving.
        <br><br>
        Data were collected for 147 parent-teen dyads (pairs) in the electronic
        logbook group and 131 parent-teen dyads in the paper logbook group for 6
         continuous months while teenagers held a learner permit to practice
        driving under the supervision of a licensed driver. Self-reported
        driving was collected using six consecutive monthly surveys where
        parents/guardians were asked to report the amount of driving completed
        by their teen during the past week. App-recorded trips for the same week
         were identified for each electronic logbook dyad and compared with
        their survey data.
        <br><br>
        On average, participants reported driving 2.5 trips and 3.0 hours in the
         prior week, with a wide between-subjects range in practice driving.
        There were no statistically significant differences in any measures of
        self-reported practice driving (trips, hours, or variety) by logbook
        type (electronic vs. paper). Agreement between self-reported and
        app-recorded trips ranged from 68.6% to 79.0% of trips (allowing for a
        difference of two trips per week). User satisfaction with the electronic
         logbook was high, with 93.0% of teenagers and 91.9% of parents stating
        they would recommend the app to a friend. A slightly lower percentage of
         participants stated they would be willing to continue to use the app
        beyond the study period (89.5% of teenagers and 86.2% of parents).
        Almost half of teenagers (42.1%) and one third of parents (30.1%)
        reported issues using the app at some point during the study, and a
        small percentage of participants stated the app was a burden
        (6.1% of teenagers and 4.9% of parents).
        <br><br>
        The findings demonstrate that the use of an electronic logbook is a
        viable approach to measuring practice driving during the learner stage
        of licensure. There was no difference in the self- reported amount of
        driving between the paper logbook and electronic logbook groups,
        suggesting that practice driving behavior was not impacted by the data
        collection method.

    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">This article reviews existing state laws related to autonomous vehicle safety, equity,

    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"Teenagers in the United States are at the
          highest risk of crash during the first year of independent driving.
          Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) policies, vehicle choice, and safety
          technologies all have an impact on teenager safety, yet little is
          known about parent and teenager attitudes and beliefs that impact the
          choices and decisions surrounding these issues. We conducted six focus
           groups and used a grounded theory approach to qualitatively analyze
          the data. We found there were mixed perceptions about safety
          technologies, a consensus that logbooks did not accurately reflect the
           number of hours driven by the teenagers, and that overall parents
          believed older cars were safer and the more financially responsible
          choice. These attitudes and beliefs were heavily influenced by
          personal experiences and perceptions, rather than quantitative
          evidence, with many examples of availability, substitution, and
          outcome cognitive biases. By understanding the influence of cognitive
          biases on driving safety decisions, community-based educational
          outreach programs can more effectively improve teenager driver
          safety."</h2>

    <div class="info-writing-black">
        <h2 class="black-text">"Baltimore’s public transportation infrastructure is failing Baltimoreans. It is failing low
            and mid-income Baltimoreans, who are disproportionately cut off from job opportunities and forced to endure
            extremely long commutes. It is failing Baltimore’s students who are cut off from employment and educational
            opportunities as they try to make their way out of poverty. It is failing the health of all Baltimoreans by
            preventing access to fresh food and healthcare and by discouraging walking and biking as part of commutes.
            If Baltimore invests in new public transportation systems that are safe, reachable, reliable, and rapid, our
            city can see improved health outcomes through greater transportation efficiency."

    </div>
    <div class="info-writing">
        <h2 class="white">"Some might consider it sympathy when someone is 'imagining how he himself might feel were he
            to be placed in the exact same situation' as someone else. However, Fennell argues, since this person is
            only imagining this situation and is not in the situation, this would be more adequately described as
            empathy. Per Fennell, sympathy is beyond just feeling <strong>for</strong> someone; it is feeling
            <strong>with</strong> them. Sympathy means that you can reason with someone’s state, but you can also get
            down to the level of their state, drawing from a set of shared conditions and experiences. When experiencing
            sympathy, you and the other person are resonating on the same wavelength; you just get each other. The
            Chicago Housing Authority believed that, by forging sympathetic bonds between people, they could address and
            mitigate many of the problems that public housing residents faced."
